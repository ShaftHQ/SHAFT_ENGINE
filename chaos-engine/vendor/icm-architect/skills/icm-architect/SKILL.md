description: Design any process, idea, problem, or body of knowledge into an ICM (Interpretable Context Methodology) workspace — folder structure as agent architecture — or restructure an existing folder, repo, or vault into one. Use when the user wants to (1) turn a recurring workflow into an agent-runnable folder pipeline, (2) organize scattered notes, files, or knowledge into a library one AI agent can walk, (3) map a team or company as connected context ("context map", "second brain", "team brain", "knowledge base for AI"), (4) audit a codebase or mixed folder into a walkable edit map (objects, processes, change-impact) so later agents can change it without slurping the tree, (5) audit or restructure an existing workspace to ICM conventions, or (6) says "make this an ICM", "ICM this", "map this repo", "audit this folder", "what would a change hit", "build me a workspace", or "structure this for agents".

# ICM Architect

Build workspaces where the folder structure does the orchestration. One agent, reading the right files at the right moment, replaces a multi-agent framework: numbered folders carry sequencing, hierarchy carries context scoping, plain markdown files carry state. A human can open any folder and see exactly what state the system is in, because state is just files.

Think of the workspace as a library. The routing files are the catalog: small, stable, they point at everything and store almost nothing. The content lives on the shelves (stage folders, node files, reference material). One librarian — one model — walks the building, and the question decides which shelf gets walked to. Nobody photocopies the library into a backpack; that is what context-stuffing is. The catalog is small on purpose.

Method: Interpretable Context Methodology (Van Clief & McDermott, arXiv:2603.16021, MIT-licensed).

## The invariants

Every ICM, whatever its form, obeys these. When building or restructuring, enforce all ten:

1. **One folder, one job.** Each folder does a single step or holds a single kind of thing, and states its own purpose in a file inside itself. The structure is the documentation.
2. **A small, stable entry file.** `CLAUDE.md` (or `AGENTS.md`) at the root answers "where am I, where does everything live, where do I go for task X" — and nothing else. Target under ~60 lines. It routes; it never holds content.
3. **Numbering encodes order.** `01_`, `02_`, … where sequence matters. Renaming folders reorders the pipeline — that is the point.
4. **Every folder-level contract is explicit.** A `CONTEXT.md` per working folder: what it reads (inputs), what it does (process), what it writes (outputs), what a human checks. See [assets/templates/stage-CONTEXT.md](assets/templates/stage-CONTEXT.md).
5. **Factory vs. product.** Reference material (rules, voice, schemas, templates — stable across runs) lives structurally apart from working artifacts (outputs, drafts — new every run). Configure the factory once; the product is what each run emits.
6. **Every output is an edit surface.** Intermediate outputs are plain files a human can open, edit, and save before the next step reads them. Nothing moves forward until a person has read the last output.
7. **Load only what the step needs.** An agent executing a step reads its contract, its references, and its inputs — not the whole workspace. 2,000–8,000 tokens per step is the healthy range.
8. **Plain text, linkable, queryable.** Markdown + YAML frontmatter. Links (`[[wikilinks]]` or relative paths) make it a graph; frontmatter labels make it queryable. One home per fact — a link beats a copy.
9. **The filesystem is the state machine.** "Status" is derivable by scanning what exists in output folders. Generated indexes (file maps, logs) are rebuilt by script, never hand-edited.
10. **Instantiate by copying.** New unit of work = copy a template folder, not a blank page. Keep templates in a `_templates/` folder.

## Choose a mode

- **Building from a described process, idea, or problem** → Build mode.
- **An existing folder, repo, or vault that needs ICM structure** → Restructure mode.
- **A body of work later agents must edit** (code, markdown, or mixed) → System map form. Read [references/system-map.md](references/system-map.md) after picking the form.

## Build mode

**1. Extract the structure from dialogue.** The structure is already in how the person describes the work — don't impose a shape, surface theirs. Ask (a few at a time, not all at once):

- What is the repeating unit of work? (an episode, a client, a report, a person, a team?)
- Walk me through one run, start to finish. Where do you stop and check something before continuing?
- What stays the same every run (voice, rules, brand, schema) vs. what is new every run?
- What does "done" look like — what artifact leaves the workspace?
- Who else touches this, and what do they need to find without asking you?

Their pauses become stage boundaries. Their "I always check X before Y" become human gates. Their "it always has to sound like / follow Z" becomes factory reference material.

**2. Pick the form.** Read [references/forms.md](references/forms.md) and choose:

| Form | Reach for it when |
|---|---|
| **Pipeline** | The same sequence runs repeatedly, producing a deliverable each run |
| **Umbrella** | Several distinct pipelines share one brand/voice/reference layer |
| **Record library** | The unit is a record (person, client, session) that accumulates, not a run |
| **Knowledge bundle** | The product is navigable knowledge itself (a brain, a wiki, a model of something) |
| **Context map** | The subject is an organization — teams, processes, data, and the links between them |
| **System map** | A folder later agents will edit — nouns, movements, and what a change hits. Method: [references/system-map.md](references/system-map.md) |

Real workspaces mix forms (a record library whose records are mini knowledge bundles; a pipeline that emits into a record library). Compose freely — the invariants hold at every level, recursively.

**3. Scaffold the smallest structure that carries the work.** Copy starters from [assets/templates/](assets/templates/) and fill them in. Do not create folders for stages that don't exist yet, empty "misc" buckets, or speculative depth. Three real stages beat seven imagined ones. If the whole job fits in one saved prompt, say so and don't build a workspace at all.

**4. Write the contracts.** Root `CLAUDE.md` (identity + routing table), root `CONTEXT.md` (the pipeline or schema definition), one `CONTEXT.md` per stage/hub folder, `setup/questionnaire.md` if the factory needs configuring per user. Write inputs as explicit file paths, split into working (this run) and reference (every run).

**5. Validate with the walk test** (below).

## Restructure mode

**1. Inventory before touching.** List the tree. For each area note: what it is, when last touched, what refers to it. Never delete or move in this pass.

**2. Find the hidden form.** Ask the owner (or infer and confirm): what is the repeating unit here? Where does work enter and leave? The mess usually contains a real pipeline, library, or map that grew without a skeleton — extract it, don't replace it. Interview the folder the way you'd interview the person.

**3. Classify every file** into one of five roles:
- **Catalog** — identity/routing (becomes or feeds `CLAUDE.md` / index files)
- **Contract** — describes how a step works (becomes a `CONTEXT.md`)
- **Factory** — stable reference (→ `_shared/`, `_system/`, or `references/`)
- **Product** — run-specific artifacts (→ stage `output/` or record folders)
- **Dead** — stale, duplicated, or superseded (→ propose `_archive/`, never silently delete). A file is Dead only after step 4 confirms nothing depends on it — apparent disuse is not proof.

**4. Verify reference integrity — before proposing.** Apparent disuse is not proof of safety. Before any file is proposed for a move — especially a `Dead → _archive/` move — enumerate what points at it: in-vault, sibling-path (`../`), symlink, and outside this workspace (other repos, configs, scheduled jobs that hardcode a path in). External consumers are a question for the human gate, not an unbounded grep. A file with a live referrer is held, or moved only if every referrer is updated in the same change. See [references/reference-integrity.md](references/reference-integrity.md).

**5. Propose before moving.** Present the target tree and a migration map (old path → new path → role → referrers found). Get approval. This is a human gate in a method built on human gates — honor it. The reviewer approves against the reference report from step 4, not against a hunch.

**6. Migrate — copy, verify, then remove.** Never move-and-hope. Before any copy or rename, check whether the destination already exists **case-folded** — on Windows and macOS, `CLAUDE.md` → `CONTEXT.md` silently overwrites an existing `context.md`, and a file-inventory map will not show the collision. Surface every hit at the approval gate. Then copy to the new home, verify parity (file count and content hash) against the source, and only then remove the original. Write the entry file and contracts, de-duplicate toward one-home-per-fact (leave a link where the copy lived if anything referenced it). Separate method from instance: if the structure will be reused elsewhere, the blank template lives apart from this filled-in deployment.

**7. Validate with the walk test.**

## The walk test

Validate any ICM — new or restructured — by walking it cold, as an agent with no memory:

- Open the root. Can you answer *where am I* and *where do I go for the current task* within the entry file plus at most two more reads?
- Pick any stage/node. Does its contract name exact input paths, the job, the output, and the human check?
- Can you state pipeline status purely by scanning what exists in `output/` folders (or node frontmatter)?
- Is any routing file carrying content payload? Move the payload to a shelf; leave a pointer.
- Is any fact stored in two places? Pick one home; link from the other.
- After a restructure: does every reference that existed *before* the move still resolve? A moved file that something still points at is a break, not a tidy-up.
- Token check: entry file + one contract + its inputs should land in roughly 2k–8k tokens.
- System map only: can a cold agent answer *what is X* and *what else moves if I change X* from `map/CLAUDE.md` plus one card? Extra checks are in [references/system-map.md](references/system-map.md).

If a step fails, fix the structure — not by explaining more, but by moving or splitting files until the walk works.

## Guardrails

- **Don't over-structure.** The ladder runs: chat → saved prompt/skill → folders + one agent. Only climb when the rung below is genuinely automated and repeating. A workspace for a thing done twice is scaffolding, not architecture.
- **Know where ICM loses.** Real-time multi-agent collaboration, high-concurrency multi-user serving, and automated mid-pipeline branching genuinely need framework code. ICM is for sequential, human-reviewed, repeatable work — which is most knowledge work, but not all of it.
- **Anti-patterns seen in the wild:** duplicated entry files that drift (generate one from the other, or make one a pointer); schema documents that mandate names the actual files stopped using (update the schema or the files — pick one); hand-edits to generated indexes; workshop sessions that produce slides instead of structured data (every working session should end in an artifact the structure can hold); patterns declared top-down (one team complaining is a gripe — the same shape appearing three independent times is structure).
