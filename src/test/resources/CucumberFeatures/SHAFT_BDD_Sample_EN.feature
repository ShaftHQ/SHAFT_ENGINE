    And I Type "SHAFT_Engine" into the element found by "name": "q"
    And I Press the "Enter" key into the element found by "name": "q"
    Then I Assert that the "href" attribute of the element found by "xpath": "(//h2[text()='Web result with site links']/following::a)[1]", equals "https://github.com/MohabMohie/SHAFT_ENGINE"
    And I Close the current window
